# Salary Prediction based on job details
## Description
This project entails data analysis and predictive modeling on a salary dataset. We use the model to give an estimate on how salaries are being distributed based on factors such as Industry, Position and more.
### Libraries used
Python3, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, MatplotLib.
### Algorithms used for modeling 
Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Polynomial Regression.
### Challenges faced in Data Analysis(Preprocessing) and Visualization.
* Challenges faced in preprocessing: Salaries = 0 (Corrupt data)
* Lot of outliers (7000+ records) needed to be removed
* Correlation mapping with categorical data. 

## Summary
When we apply gradient boosting we got a score of 342 on the non polynomial dataset. The same model can be used as a tool within companies and by people to get a fair estimate of their salary based on the features described in the model.
